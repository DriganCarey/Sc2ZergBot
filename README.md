# Sc2ZergBot
A bot that should hopefully be able to make decisions and follow build orders in order to play the strategy game known as starcraft II

My aim:
  1. Bot will be able to manage (pull idle drones to mine and move drones from oversaturated bases) and produce drones
  2. build overlords to avoid supply blocks
  3. Bot should be able to do a simple 17 hatch 18 gas 17 pool opener
  4. Bot should build injecting queens and inject constantly
  5. Bot should try to avoid floating whenever possible
  6. Follow a 13 12 build order randomly
  6. Bot should be able to scout
  7. Attacking
  8. Micro
  ....
  a. Bot can defeat the very easy ai
  b. Bot can defeat the easy ai
  c. Bot can defeat the medium ai
  d. Bot can defeat the hard ai
  e. Bot can defeat the very hard ai
  f. Bot can defeat the elite ai
  g. Bot can defeat the insane cheater ai
  ....
  x. Bot will be able to choose a build order at the beginning of the game and attempt to follow the build order, making decisions/changes as it sees fit to react to the opponent
  x + 1. Machine learning?

Other details:
  I want to try and build a decision tree - the bot should only try to take one action at a time
  Want to attempt to randomise choices in order to prevent bot from acting completely predictably
